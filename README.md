# Kotlin Cheatsheet

This is me following Derek Banas an hour and a half long tutorial on the basics of Kotlin  
Seems like a very sweet language that shows signs of python and java but at the same time
also very similar to OCaml.  
This 'project' will not be maintained. But rather, for me to look back on if I ever get a
chance to write a project in this language.
